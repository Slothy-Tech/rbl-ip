<h1>Bypass IP Ban in Roblox</h1>
<p>This guide walks you through how to bypass an IP ban in Roblox (PC). Whether you were banned from a specific game server or the entire platform, these steps will help you reset your network identity, clean your system, and avoid getting flagged again.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Roblox bans may affect your IP, account, and browser/device fingerprint — especially for violations like exploiting, cheating, or inappropriate behavior.</li>
    <li>Many bans are automatic and tied to your last known login method, network, and cookies.</li>
    <li>This guide focuses on bypassing IP-based bans using safe and realistic steps that target all layers of Roblox's tracking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Method: Mandatory Steps to Bypass IP Bans</h2>
<p>Follow these steps exactly and in order. Each one helps remove traces of the ban from your system and ensures your new account stays clean.</p>

<h3>1. Changing Your IP Address</h3>
<p>Your IP address is the first thing Roblox uses to block your device from accessing the platform. Getting a new one is essential.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using a VPN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Install a paid VPN with clean residential IPs. Free VPNs often use flagged or shared IPs that Roblox already bans.</li>
            <li>Connect to a new server and confirm your new IP using <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com">whatismyipaddress.com</a> before opening Roblox.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Switch Networks:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a mobile hotspot, switch Wi-Fi networks, or reset your modem to get a new IP from your ISP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Roblox sometimes shadowbans VPN users. Stick to servers with residential IPs or test first on a fresh account.</p>

<h3>2. Clearing Cache and Cookies</h3>
<p>Roblox tracks users through browser cookies and saved sessions, especially if you log in through roblox.com or use the web launcher.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your browser settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data.</li>
            <li>Select “Cookies and other site data” and “Cached images and files.”</li>
            <li>Clear everything and restart your browser before logging in again.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you log back into an old banned account, your new IP could get flagged again — avoid doing this at all costs.</p>

<h3>3. Uninstalling and Reinstalling Roblox</h3>
<p>Removing Roblox clears out cached launcher data and settings that might still contain identifiers.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall Roblox from Control Panel or Windows Settings.</li>
            <li>Manually delete leftover folders:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Roblox</code></li>
                    <li><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Roblox</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Restart your PC and reinstall Roblox from the official site.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not install Roblox while still connected to a banned IP or with cookies still present. Follow the order carefully.</p>

<h3>4. Changing MAC Address</h3>
<p>While Roblox doesn’t always track MAC addresses directly, spoofing yours can help avoid rare cases where device-level bans are in play.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network Connections.</li>
            <li>Right-click your adapter → Properties → Configure → Advanced tab.</li>
            <li>Find “Network Address” or “Locally Administered Address” → enable it and enter a new random MAC.</li>
            <li>Click OK and restart your PC.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is more of a safety step for full identity spoofing. It’s optional but recommended if you’ve had multiple bans.</p>

<h2>How It Works Together</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Changes your IP so Roblox sees you as a new network user.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Clears tracking cookies and login data that could identify your browser or previous sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Resets any local files or cached data from your old Roblox client.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Spoofs your MAC to avoid rare device tracking or flagging issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination erases all the obvious links between your banned identity and your new one. But keeping it clean moving forward is up to you.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a brand-new Roblox account with a unique email, username, and avatar style.</li>
    <li>Don’t reuse any usernames, payment methods, or device names from banned accounts.</li>
    <li>Avoid joining the same games you were banned from immediately — some servers track IP histories.</li>
    <li>Don’t use exploits or alt generators — many of them are already flagged or report back to Roblox.</li>
    <li>Log in through the desktop app instead of a browser for fewer tracking variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method gives you a clean return to Roblox while avoiding detection or re-bans. Be smart, take your time, and treat your new account like a second chance.</p>
